      Hello, my name is Rocktem Bhowmik. I am currently a Computer Science major at
      Stony Brook University.
      Pursuing a career in game development and design, I find myself captivated in
      the many things there are for me to learn.
      I am particularly interested in learning UI/UX development, as the menu designs
      I've seen in the games I've played have always been awe inspiring to me.
      I'm not quite sure when this interest began, or when this desire had welled up
      within me, but I'm certain that it was my lifetime exposure to my hobbies.
      I also find a great interest in the ability to portray stories through video games
      The interactive element allows players to truly immerse themselves in a story, especially
      when the main character is them.
      And I want to provide that experience to as many as I can.
      However, it is certain that the first thing that I require to achieve any of this
      is experience.
      That experience being working in the field, cooperating with others in development
      projects, and the many skills I've yet to learn.
      I can't wait to see where I go from here on in my effort to get to where I want to be
      and I'm ecstatic for the work I'll be immersing myself in until then.
